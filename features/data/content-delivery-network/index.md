# Content Delivery Network (CDN)

The Content Delivery Network (CDN) is an infrastructure used to deliver assets - such as images, audio, binary content, etc. - to the end user that focuses on speed and availability.

CDN costs are independent from your tier (Essentials, Professional, etc.), and require a payment account to be set up with PlayFab.

This can be done by entering your credit card information in the **Admin**->**Billing** tab of your title. CDN costs are based on your usage.

> [!NOTE]
> Please use the **Content**->**File Management** tab for more information on this subject, or contact our [developer forum](https://community.playfab.com/) with any questions that you may have.
