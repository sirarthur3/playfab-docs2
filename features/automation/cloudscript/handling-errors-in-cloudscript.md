# Handling errors in CloudScript

This tutorial describes how to recognize and handle errors within your CloudScript handlers.

## Identifying

The first step is identifying the error. While every uncaught error is logged and available from the response to the caller (client), you may still catch the error early by using a `try/catch` block.

Consider the following CloudScript snippet that produces and catches the error.

```javascript
"use strict";

handlers.GenerateError = () => {
    try {
        server.GetPlayerStatistics({
            PlayFabId : "non-existing-player-id"
        });
    } catch (ex) {
        let error = ex.apiErrorInfo.apiError.error; // In this case - "InvalidParams"
        let errorCode = ex.apiErrorInfo.apiError.errorCode; // In this case : 1000
    }
}
```

Notice how the error codes were extracted within the catch block? Consult our [Global API Method Error Codes](global-api-method-error-codes.md) tutorial, for a complete list of errors and their identifying codes.

> [!NOTE]
> The error code on its own is sufficient to identify the error.

## Logging

Any unhandled error will be added to the response, allowing the client to process the problem.

At the same time, it does create a CloudScript error entry, and is added to the total statistics available on your CloudScript dashboard.

To force-log the exception in the form of a JSON string, use error logging via the `log` object.

```javascript
"use strict";

handlers.GenerateError = () => {
    try {
        server.GetPlayerStatistics({
            PlayFabId : "non-existing-player-id"
        });
    } catch (ex) {
        log.error(ex);
    }
}
```

Finally, you may write title/player events for later processing through analytics.

```javascript
"use strict";

handlers.GenerateError = () => {
    try {
        server.GetPlayerStatistics({
            PlayFabId : "non-existing-player-id"
        });
    } catch (ex) {
        server.WriteTitleEvent({
            EventName : 'cs_error',
            Body : ex
        });
    }
}
```

## Recovery

It's not always possible to recover from errors. Issues like `InvalidArguments` leave you with no option but to report the problem back to the player.

There are a subset of errors where a retry strategy can be applied. *Retry-able* error types are described in the [Global API Method Error Codes](global-api-method-error-codes.md) tutorial.

We ask that you *make sure* you meet the following requirements when applying a retry strategy:

- With each retry, the delay between retries should *increase* exponentially. This increases your chances for a successful call, and prevents your game from spamming the PlayFab server (which will result in *more* rejected calls).

- You should apply this retry strategy *selectively*, only using it for those codes that are worth retrying.
