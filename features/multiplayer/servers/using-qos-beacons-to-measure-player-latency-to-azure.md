# Using Quality-of-Service (QoS) beacons to measure player latency to Azure

You can deploy PlayFab multiplayer servers to more than a dozen Azure regions. There are two reasons to do this:

1. Additional regions provide redundancy, so if a single Azure region fails, players can access servers on other regions.
2. Additional regions allow players to access servers that are “nearby” and deliver low-latency connectivity.

When you call [RequestMultiplayerServer](xref:titleid.playfabapi.com.multiplayer.multiplayerserver.requestmultiplayerserver), you specify a ranked list of Azure regions that PlayFab uses to fulfill the request. PlayFab will attempt to fulfill the request using the #1 ranked region, but if there aren't servers standing by in that region, or the region has some other fault, a sub-optimal region further down the list will be attempted.

Whenever possible, you should use player latency data to inform the ranking of Azure regions used while requesting a multiplayer server. PlayFab provides services and tools to help with this task.

## Quality-of-service beacons

PlayFab operates beacons in every Azure region in use by PlayFab multiplayer servers. These beacons will reflect UDP traffic and can be used to measure latency with UDP transport.

The usage of UDP is important, because most multiplayer games use UDP transport for their most performance-critical game traffic. Internet service providers and other elements of the Internet ecosystem may deliver differentiated performance for UDP vs. TCP vs. ICMP flows.

This is the typical flow for using these beacons in the context of a player device:

1. Login the player to PlayFab. This is typically done with a [LoginWithCustomID](xref:titleid.playfabapi.com.client.authentication.loginwithcustomid) or another login API.
2. Call [ListQoSServers](xref:titleid.playfabapi.com.multiplayer.multiplayerserver.listqosservers). This provides hostnames to PlayFab’s QoS beacons. A typical implementation might have this procedure occur on the **Multiplayer Menu** page for the game.
3. Create a UDP socket.
4. Send a single UDP datagram to port 3075 on the QoS server. The message content must start with 2 bytes of 255 (1111 1111 1111 1111).  
5. The server will reply with a single datagram, with the message contents having the first 2 bytes "flipped" to **0** (**0000 0000 0000 0000**). The rest of the datagram contents will be copied from the initial ping.
6. Measure the time between sending the UDP message and receiving a response.

## Using the quality-of-service C++ SDK

PlayFab provides C++ sub-routines demonstrating this QoS flow in the [PlayFab cross-platform (CPP) SDK](https://github.com/PlayFab/XPlatCppSdk). You can build the SDK and use it as a helper library in your PC games, or use the code as an example for other platforms.

These are the two QoS APIs available in the [PlayFab cross-platform (CPP) SDK](https://github.com/PlayFab/XPlatCppSdk), as noted below.

```cpp
  // Runs a QoS operation asynchronously. The operation pings a set of datacenters and returns a result with average response times.
  std::future<QoSResult> GetQoSResultAsync(unsigned int numThreads, unsigned int timeoutMs = DEFAULT_TIMEOUT_MS);

  // Runs a QoS operation synchronously. The operation pings a set of datacenters and returns a result with average response times.
  QoSResult GetQoSResult(unsigned int numThreads, unsigned int timeoutMs = DEFAULT_TIMEOUT_MS);
```
