# Quickstart for multiplayer servers (API/PowerShell)

This tutorial helps you quickly upload a sample multiplayer server, configure a server build, and create server instances.

On a Windows 10 PC, get the following prerequisites ready:

- A PlayFab title ID - this needs to be a title that PlayFab has authorized for the private preview.
- A developer key for the title (See [Getting PlayFab Developer Keys](../../config/gamemanager/getting-playfab-developer-keys.md)).
- [Game Server SDK Sample - Windows Runner](https://github.com/PlayFab/gsdkSamples/releases/)

## Install the PlayFab Multiplayer PowerShell module

1. Install the [PlayFab Multiplayer PowerShell module](https://www.powershellgallery.com/packages/PlayFabMultiplayer) by opening a Windows Powershell window as Administrator and run the command:

```powershell
Install-Module PlayFabMultiplayer
```

2. You can learn more about the cmdlets in the PlayFab Multiplayer PowerShell module by running the following command.

```powershell
Get-Command -Module PlayFabMultiplayer| Get-Help
```

## Enable multiplayer servers for your title

In the **PowerShell** window, run the following command using your title ID and associated developer key:

```powershell
Set-PFTitle -TitleID "mytitleID" -secretkey "mysecretkey"
```

This command uses the [PlayFab C# SDK](https://www.nuget.org/packages/PlayFabAllSDK/) to call [GetEntityToken](xref:titleid.playfabapi.com.authentication.authentication.getentitytoken). Now let's [enable multiplayer servers](xref:titleid.playfabapi.com.multiplayer.multiplayerserver.enablemultiplayerserversfortitle) for the title:

```powershell
Enable-PFMultiplayerServer
```

## Upload a game server executable as an asset

We're going to use the *managed containers* option to create a build. With managed containers, your game server build is created by uploading assets that are combined with a Windows container image. For this tutorial, upload the `winrunnerSample.zip` folder from the sample servers package you downloaded earlier

```powershell
Add-PFMultiplayerAsset -FilePath "C:\winrunnerSample.zip"
```

### Create a build

Now that the asset is uploaded, we can create a build.

```powershell  
$VMSelection = [PlayFab.MultiplayerModels.AzureVMSize]::Standard_D2_v2

$Ports = New-object PlayFab.MultiplayerModels.Port
$Ports.Name = "game_port"
$Ports.Num = 3600
$Ports.Protocol = [PlayFab.MultiplayerModels.ProtocolType]::TCP

New-PFMultiplayerBuild -BuildName "PSTest_built"  -StartMultiplayerServerCommand "C:\Assets\WindowsRunnerCSharp.exe" -Ports $Ports -VMSize $VMSelection -AssetReferences $Asset -MultiplayerServerCountPerVm 1 -RegionConfiguration $Regions
```

In a few seconds we should see the build through the **PowerShell** or [ListBuildSummaries API](xref:titleid.playfabapi.com.multiplayer.multiplayerserver.listbuildsummaries), as shown below.

```powershell
Get-PFMultiplayerBuild -All
```

### Request a multiplayer server

Now that we've got a build, lets see standing by servers get created.

```powershell
Get-PFMultiplayerServer
```

Once we see some standing by servers, let's request one for gameplay...

```powershell
$Regions = new-object 'System.Collections.Generic.List[PlayFab.MultiplayerModels.AzureRegion]'
$Regions.Add("EastUS");

New-PFMultiplayerServer -BuildName "MyBuild" -SessionId "00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000001" -SessionCookie "test cookie" -PreferredRegions $regions -BuildCerts $null
```

This is the core of PlayFab multiplayer servers: within 3 seconds of your matchmaking service calling [RequestMultiplayerServer](xref:titleid.playfabapi.com.multiplayer.multiplayerserver.requestmultiplayerserver), PlayFab will allocate a new server.

These servers come from continuously refilled, standing-by server pools you configure on a per-region and per-build basis. After gameplay ends the server is recycled.

### Configure regional settings

To tune the number of standing-by servers and regional allocation, the portal might be simpler to use than the APIs.

In Game Manager, you should see a **Multiplayer** tab and your builds listed under **Servers 2.0**, as shown below.

Select the title of a build to navigate to it's regional configuration, as seen here.

![Region Simple Input](media/tutorials/region-simple-input.png)

From this point you can add more regions, modify standing-by targets, and regional maximums.
