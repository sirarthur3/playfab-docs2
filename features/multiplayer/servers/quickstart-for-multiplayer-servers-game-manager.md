# Quickstart for multiplayer servers (Game Manager)

This tutorial shows you how to upload a sample multiplayer server and configure a server build.

## Enable Multiplayer Servers 2.0

**Multiplayer Servers 2.0** is available to PlayFab indie, pro, and enterprise-tier customers. If your title does not have access but you are interested in evaluating the service, please email [sales@PlayFab.com](mailto:sales@playfab.com).

Enable the feature by selecting the **Multiplayer** tab in **Game Manager**:

## Download and build the GDSK sample

Multiplayer servers work through a special state machine, by integrating with the PlayFab Game Server SDK (GSDK) (see [Basics of a PlayFab game server](basics-of-a-playfab-game-server.md)).

GSDK samples show this integration through a very simple HTTP server sample app.

> [!NOTE]
> You can download a compiled version of the sample app directly from [github](https://github.com/PlayFab/gsdkSamples/releases/download/v1.0/winrunnerSample.zip).

If you want to build the app yourself, download the [GSDK samples from github](https://github.com/PlayFab/gsdkSamples), using standard git methods or downloading as a zip file.

Opening the Visual Studio project should automatically trigger dependencies like the [Game Server SDK nuget package](https://www.nuget.org/packages/com.playfab.csharpgsdk) to be downloaded.

Build the project in an x64 RELEASE flavor, as shown below.

ZIP up the produced x64 release binaries. There should be no internal folder structure, the zip file should be a simple flat collection of files, as shown in the following example.

You can compare your build output with the compiled release on [github](https://github.com/PlayFab/gsdkSamples/releases/download/v1.0/winrunnerSample.zip).

## Upload assets and create a multiplayer server build

On the **Multiplayer Servers 2.0** page, select **New Build** at the top right. Configure a new build as found in the example shown below.

1. **Build Name.** This is a string used to refer to the build.
2. **Virtual machine selection**. The Azure virtual machine type used to host this multiplayer server build. Standards **D1_v2** is a suggested choice, and available to customers by default. Learn about other virtual machine selections at [Multiplayer Servers detailed price sheet](multiplayer-servers-detailed-price-sheet.md).
3. **Servers per machine.** How many multiplayer servers will be hosted on each virtual machine. For testing, start with a value of **one.**
4. **Network.** The GSDK sample operates a simple web server on **Port 3600**. It is important we specify this port name as **game_port**, because the game server inspects the port name through the GSDK API. See [Connecting clients to game servers](connecting-clients-to-game-servers.md) for more networking information.
5. **Assets.** Upload the GSDK sample zip file. PlayFab will unzip this folder and mount it in the container file-system as a folder you specify in the **C**  drive. `C:\Assets` is a good example, and that would result in a start game command of `C:\Assets\WindowsRunnerCSharp.exe`.

### Configure regions

After selecting the **Next** button at the bottom of your screen, you will need to configure standing-by levels and regional maximums. For testing purposes, let's configure a single standing-by server in East US.

### Wait for the build to initialize

After selecting the **Deploy** button, you will be taken to the build home page. You can monitor the deployment of your build from here. In 10 to 20 minutes your build should be in the **Deployed** state.
