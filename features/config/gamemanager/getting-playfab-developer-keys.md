# Getting PlayFab developer keys

A PlayFab developer key is used to authorize an application to use PlayFab admin and server APIs for a specific title. A developer key is strongly coupled with a PlayFab title.

## Acquiring a developer key

In **Game Manager**, navigate to your **Title**, then:

1. Select **Settings** on the menu to the left.
2. Then select the **Secret Keys** tab.
3. Locate the default key in the field under the **Secret Key** column on the screen.

## Multiple keys

Generally, the default key is sufficient to authorize your application for admin and server API calls. However, you may also select the **New Secret Key** button **(1)**.

1. Fill in the title for your **New Key** in the **Name** field provided.
2. Enter an optional **Expiration Date**.
3. Select the **Save Secret Key** button.

This will create a new key that you may use to authorize admin and server API calls.

### Use case for multiple keys

You may need *temporary* keys if you are outsourcing some work to another company. You may also need to *revoke* a key that has accidentally been made public. You can create new keys and revoke keys as needed.
