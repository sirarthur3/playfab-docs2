# PlayFab recipes and samples

Here are some links to recipes and samples that you can download and run, to gain a better understanding of how to use PlayFab features in code.

## Recipes

This collection of examples shows familiar patterns and mechanics implemented using PlayFab.

### Player retention

- [Daily Prize Wheel](https://github.com/PlayFab/PlayFab-Samples/tree/master/Recipes/PrizeWheel) - Give players a randomized gift every day, based on the values on a "Prize Wheel".
- [Progressive Reward System](https://github.com/PlayFab/PlayFab-Samples/tree/master/Recipes/ProgressiveRewards) - Players that sign in consecutively over several days are granted an item, depending on how long their login streak is.

### User acquisition
