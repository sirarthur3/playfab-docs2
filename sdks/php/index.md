# PHP

![PHP logo](../media/sdk-php.png)

PHP is a popular general-purpose scripting language, that works particularly well for server-side web development. Our PHP SDK provides everything you need to access the PlayFab API.

For a list of prerequisites and instructions on how to set up a project using the PlayFab PHP SDK, please refer to the [PHP quickstart](quickstart.md).

This SDK was auto-generated by ourÂ [SDKGenerator](../sdkgenerator/index.md). We generally build SDKs every week, to remain current with the latest API changes.
