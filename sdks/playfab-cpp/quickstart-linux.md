# C++ quickstart for Linux

This quickstart helps you make your first API call in C++. A native C++ project can be used a few ways:

- Stand-alone console Admin tools for maintaining your game.
  - The PlayFab Cross-Platform C++ SDK works great for a stand-alone C++ program.

- Integration into an existing C++ based game engine.
  - The PlayFab Cross-Platform C++ SDK should not be used if we provide a more specific SDK.
    - [Cocos2d-x](https://github.com/PlayFab/Cocos2d-xSDK)
    - [Unreal](https://github.com/PlayFab/UnrealCppSdk)

  - Many C++ based engines also integrate Lua:
    - [LuaSdk]<https://github.com/PlayFab/LuaSdk)>

If you have any issues, let us know on the [Forums](https://community.playfab.com/index.html).

## Linux C++ Project Setup

OS: This guide is written for Linux, using Ubuntu 18.04 LTS.

Before you can call any PlayFab API, you must have a [PlayFab developer account](https://developer.playfab.com/en-us/sign-up). 

### Installation

1. Install the following (sudo apt install ____ on Ubuntu):
    - g++
    - gdb
    - make
    - cmake
    - libjsoncpp-dev
    - libcurl4-openssl-dev
    - git-all
2. Clone [PlayFab cross-platform (CPP) SDK](https://github.com/PlayFab/XPlatCppSdk) into your project folder.  
3. Create `main.cpp` and write `Hello World` in it, as shown below.

```cpp
// main.cpp: entry point for the console application

#include <iostream>

int main()
{
    std::cout << "Hello World" << std::endl;
    return 0;
}
```

- If you're using an IDE, make sure to:
  - Add the following folders to your sources:
    - XPlatCppSdk/cppsdk/source/playfab

  - Add the following folders to your include directories:
    - XPlatCppSdk/cppsdk
    - XPlatCppSdk/cppsdk/include

  - Link the following libraries:
    - jsoncpp
    - curl
    - pthread

- Otherwise, create `CMakeLists.txt`, and fill it with the content shown below.

```cmake
cmake_minimum_required(VERSION 3.10)
set(CMAKE_CXX_STANDARD 14)

project(PlayFab_Test)

file(GLOB PF_SOURCE XPlatCppSdk/cppsdk/source/playfab/*.cpp)
add_executable(PlayFab_Test ${PF_SOURCE} main.cpp)

include_directories(XPlatCppSdk/cppsdk)
include_directories(XPlatCppSdk/cppsdk/include)
target_link_libraries(PlayFab_Test -ljsoncpp -lcurl -lpthread)
```

- Build and run the project inside your IDE, or open Terminal and run:
  - `cmake .`
  - `make`
  - `./PlayFab_Test`

Your project should compile and successfully run Hello World!

## Set up your first API call

This guide will provide the minimum steps to make your first PlayFab API call, without any GUI or on-screen feedback. Confirmation is through a console print statement.

First, replace the contents of `main.cpp` with the content shown below.

```cpp
// main.cpp: entry point for the console application

#include "playfab/PlayFabClientDataModels.h"
#include "playfab/PlayFabClientApi.h"
#include "playfab/PlayFabSettings.h"
#include <unistd.h>

using namespace PlayFab;
using namespace ClientModels;

bool finished = false;

void OnLoginSuccess(const LoginResult& result, void* customData)
{
    printf("Congratulations, you made your first successful API call!\n");
    finished = true;
}

void OnLoginFail(const PlayFabError& error, void* customData)
{
    printf("Something went wrong with your first API call.\n");
    printf("Here's some debug information:\n");
    printf(error.GenerateReport().c_str());
    printf("\n");
    finished = true;
}

int main()
{
    PlayFabSettings::titleId = "144";

    LoginWithCustomIDRequest request;
    request.CreateAccount = true;
    request.CustomId = "GettingStartedGuide";

    PlayFabClientAPI::LoginWithCustomID(request, OnLoginSuccess, OnLoginFail);

    while (PlayFabClientAPI::Update() != 0)
        sleep(1);

    printf("Press enter to exit\n");
    getchar();
    return 0;
}
```

## Finish and execute

1. Build and run the project inside your IDE, or open Terminal and run:
    - `./PlayFab_Test`

2. When it loads, you should see the following text:
    - "Congratulations, you made your first successful API call!"

3. At this point, you can start making other API calls and build your game.
    - For a list of all available client API calls, see our [PlayFab API References](../../api-references/index.md) documentation.

Happy coding!

## Deconstruct the code

This section of the guide describes each part of `main.cpp` in detail.

- `#include` declarations.
  - Including these PlayFab headers gets you access to the Client APIs. In this example, `unistd.h` is only used for `sleep()`.

- Using namespaces in PlayFab and PlayFab::ClientModels.
  - PlayFab is used for API methods and general PlayFab usage.
  - PlayFab::ClientModels is used for the objects sent to and received by Client API calls.

- `OnLoginSuccess`, `OnLoginFailure` are callback functions asynchronously invoked by `PlayFabClientAPI.LoginWithCustomID`
- `main()`
  - `PlayFabSettings::titleId = "144";`
    - Every PlayFab developer creates a title in Game Manager. When you publish your game, you must code that `titleId` into your game. This lets the client know how to access the correct data within PlayFab. For most users, just consider it a mandatory step that makes PlayFab work

  - `LoginWithCustomIDRequest` request; (and field initialization)
    - Most PlayFab API methods require input parameters, and those input parameters are packed into a request object.
    - Every API method requires a unique request object, with a mix of optional and mandatory parameters.
      - For `LoginWithCustomIDRequest`, there is a mandatory parameter of `CustomId`, which uniquely identifies a player and `CreateAccount`, which allows the creation of a new account with this call.

    - For login, most developers will want to use a more appropriate login method.
      - See the [PlayFab Login documentation](xref:titleid.playfabapi.com.client.authentication) for a list of all login methods, and input parameters. Common choices are:
        - [LoginWithAndroidDeviceID](xref:titleid.playfabapi.com.client.authentication.loginwithandroiddeviceid)
        - [LoginWithIOSDeviceID](xref:titleid.playfabapi.com.client.authentication.loginwithiosdeviceid)
        - [LoginWithEmailAddress](xref:titleid.playfabapi.com.client.authentication.loginwithemailaddress)

  - `PlayFabClientAPI::LoginWithCustomID(request, OnLoginSuccess, OnLoginFail);`
    - Triggers the threaded API call. When complete, `OnLoginSuccess` or `OnLoginFail` will be invoked appropriately.

  - `while (PlayFabClientAPI::Update() != 0) sleep(1);`
    - Update returns the number of API calls that are in-progress.
    - Update also executes the actual calls to `OnLoginSuccess` or `OnLoginFail`, once the threaded API calls are complete.
      - This allows your callbacks to execute in a thread-safe manner, when your program is inherently single-threaded.
      - True multi-threaded options are also available, but not demonstrated here.

  - Inside of `OnLoginSuccess`:
    - The result object of many API success callbacks will contain the requested information
    - `LoginResult` contains some basic information about the player, but for most users, login is simply a mandatory step before calling other APIs.

  - Inside of `OnLoginFailure`:
    - API calls can fail for many reasons, and you should always attempt to handle failure.
    - Why API calls fail (In order of likelihood):
      - `PlayFabSettings.TitleId` is not set. If you forget to set `titleId` to your title, then nothing will work.
      - Request parameters. If you have not provided the correct or required information for a particular API call, then it will fail. See `error.errorMessage`, `error.errorDetails`, or `error.GenerateErrorReport()` for more info.
      - Device connectivity issue. Cell phones lose/regain connectivity constantly, and so any API call at any time can fail randomly, and then work immediately after. Going into a tunnel can disconnect you completely.
      - PlayFab server issue. As with all software, there can be issues. See our [release notes](../../release-notes/index.md) for updates.
      - The internet is not 100% reliable. Sometimes the message is corrupted or fails to reach the PlayFab server.

    - If you are having difficulty debugging an issue, and the information within the error information is not sufficient, please visit us on our [forums](https://community.playfab.com/index.html)
