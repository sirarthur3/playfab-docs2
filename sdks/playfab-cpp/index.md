# PlayFab CPP SDK

![PlayFab CPP SDK](./media/cpp1.png)

Our PlayFab CPP SDK provides everything you need to access the PlayFab API. This includes models, methods, an HTTP wrapper for sending and receiving web requests, and JSON serialization.

It currently supports the following platforms:

- [Windows (Win32) x64](quickstart-windows.md)
- [Xbox One](quickstart-xbox.md)
- [Linux](quickstart-linux.md)

This SDK was auto-generated by ourÂ [SDKGenerator](../sdkgenerator/index.md). We generally build SDKs every week, to remain current with the latest API changes.
