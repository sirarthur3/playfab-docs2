# Unreal Marketplace Plugin - upgrade tutorial

This tutorial will step you through upgrading your project from either the PlayFab Unreal C++ SDK, or the PlayFab Unreal Blueprint SDK, to the new PlayFab Unreal Marketplace plugin.

The new Marketplace plugin covers the interface for both of our earlier SDKs:

- The Direct C++ interface
- The Blueprint interface

We merged the Blueprint interface into the Marketplace plugin, without causing any breaking changes. However, to accomplish this, some minor changes were required to the C++ SDK elements.

## General upgrade instructions

1. Remove the old PlayFab C++ or Blueprint Project SDK/Plugin from your project(s).
2. See the [Unreal Engine quickstart](quickstart.md) -  specifically the [Unreal Project Setup](quickstart.md#unreal-project-setup) section for instructions on downloading the new Marketplace plugin and adding it to your project.

## Upgrading from the Blueprint SDK to the Marketplace plugin

We are confident that Blueprint users who upgrade a project from the Blueprint SDK to the Marketplace plugin should not require any additional steps beyond replacing the plugin itself.

If you have any issues, please report them to our [Forums](https://community.playfab.com/index.html).

## Upgrading from the C++ SDK to the Marketplace plugin
  
1. Find your .Build.cs file(s).
    - Find the PlayFab dependency.
      - It may look like this:
  
        ```cpp
        PublicDependencyModuleNames.AddRange(new string[] { "PlayFab" });
        ```

    - Remove `PlayFab`, and replace it with `PlayFabCommon` and `PlayFabCpp`.
      - The new line will look something like this:
  
        ```cpp
        PublicDependencyModuleNames.AddRange(new string[] { "PlayFabCommon", "PlayFabCpp" });
        ```
  
2. A few classes have been renamed.
    - Most users have used error callbacks, so you likely used a PlayFab class named `FPlayFabError`. You will need to find *all* instances of this class, and rename them to `FPlayFabCppError`.
    - It is unlikely - but if you ever used `FPlayFabBaseModel`, you will need to rename that to `FPlayFabCppBaseModel`.
    - In the unlikely scenario that youâ€™ve been using the `LogPlayFab` object for debug logging, please switch over to your *own* log definition. If you need an immediate solution, `LogPlayFab` has been renamed `LogPlayFabCpp`.

If you have additional issues, please report them to our [Forums](https://community.playfab.com/index.html).
